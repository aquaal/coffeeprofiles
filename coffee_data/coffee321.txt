<p>The dry fragrance has perfumed sugar smells, like fresh caramel and raw cane juice. My lightest roast fell somewhere between City and City+ and showed some really sweet fruited smells in there too. The wet aroma also offers glimpses of fruit, a sort of baked fruit smell, with caramelizing sugar sweetness. As a pour over brew, my light roast produced a fruited sweetness that accented balanced bittersweetness, what is clearly a central part of this coffee's flavor profile. The cool cup boasted top notes of apple juice, golden raisin and berry wine. There's a pleasing tartness too at City/City+ that gives the acidic impression of huckleberry. And top notes aside, what's at this coffee's core is balance of sugary sweetness and tannic bittering qualities that do a lot to anchor the complex flavor matrix. More roast development will surely indulge "Grupo de Caicedo"s bittersweet side, but I personally enjoy the cup complexity that comes at the lighter end of the roast spectrum. Delicious.</p> </div>
