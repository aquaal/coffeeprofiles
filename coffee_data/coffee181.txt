<p>We bought 4 lots in total, ranging from 17 bags to as large as 85 bags, all promising the floral, vibrant Gesha cup we've come to love. This is lot number 1, which was harvested a little earlier than the other 3, and we've already sold through lot number 3 (so 2 more to go after this one!). We've been lucky enough to be the sole buyer of this coffee for several years now. They've continued to plant more coffee each year and what started as a handful of bags annually, has ballooned to more than 100 bags this time around! If the volume isn't impressive enough, we are stunned at the consistent high quality they they achieve. If you don't know the story of the Gesha cultivar, it is an old coffee type from Ethiopia that was brought to an experimental coffee garden in Costa Rica years ago as a specimen sample. It was distributed to a few farms for testing on small plots, but not much was thought of it until one of these, Esmeralda in Panama, separated it from the other cultivars and entered it in the national competition. It was so outrageously different, with fruited and floral character like a Yirga Cheffe coffee from half a world away. Now that the word is out, other farms that received some of the seed have tried to separate their Gesha coffee as well, as is the case here. The results are always a bit different: the cultivar "expresses" itself differently in terms of cup flavors at each location, influenced by weather, soil, altitude and the like. And with this coffee from the region of Acatenango, we have a Gesha cup that expresses much of that floral intensity that's become synonymous with the "Gesha" name. Harvest was quite productive this year again as the owner of the farm has dedicated even more of his farm to this varietal. We're the sole buyer of this coffee and have chosen to keep certain farm specifics to ourselves. The farm sits on the steep slopes of Volcan Acatenango between 1600 - 1700 meters and reaps the benefits of rich volcanic soil. This farm has been in the same family for a couple generations now and they've built out an impressive wet milling facility onsite as well.</p> </div>

<p>This new lot from the Acatenango farm is a bit of a departure from Lot 3, which we've already sold through. I found the cup profile showed more of a fruited sweetness and the jasmine floral notes a bit "quieter", and more integrated into the flavor profile. The dry fragrance displays smells of fruit teas when roasted light, elements of sugar in the raw and a sweet, herbal note. The wet aroma is where I start to pick up on more of the typical jasmine florals, along with a hint of wheatgrass juice. I found this lot to produce impressive body and mouthfeel, even in light roasts. My City roast had a pleasing weight to the liquor and initial cup flavors came off with hints of hibiscus flower tea and dried apple, a simple syrup sweetness, and with herbaceous aromatics. Taking the roast a shade darker to City+ sees this Gesha shape-shifting to more fruited coffee flavors, accent notes of red plum, nectarine and green apple. Softer jasmine aromatics grace the cup as well, a uniquely "Gesha" quality that you should rightly expect, though slightly more subdued than the last lot. Acidity in the light roasts is also tea-like, and with a tart apple twist as well that adds moderately bright structure in the cup.</p> </div>
