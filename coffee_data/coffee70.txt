<p>This dry-process lot comes from a privately owned processing site near Hamasho Village, tucked away in the Bombe mountains of Ethiopia's Sidama growing region. Along with coffee from their own farm called "Daye Bensa", they are buying and processing coffee from local farmers from three different growing areas nearby such as Shantawene, Bombe and Keramo villages. This lot is made up from coffees grown by farmers only in Hamasho village, none of their own estate coffee or coffees from the nearby villages are mixed in. The Hamasho site is really high up there, over 2,200 meters above sea level! It's astonishing, really, and not only responsible for producing super dense coffee, but you see some smaller size beans too. The station and farms are certified organic too, though we brought in without the certificate this year. But it does mean they register every small farmer who they buy from and certify that organic agricultural practices are being employed at the farm level (they're also Rain Forest Alliance and UTZ certified). A note on the small beans. The majority of the coffee is 15+, but we are spotting quite a few 13 and 14 screen beans in there too. The biggest concern here is that these smaller, lower density beans will roast faster than the largest coffee. While that can be true, we found that either sticking to City to City+ roast range or slowing down the last leg of the roast helps keep the small beans from charring and darker 'roast' flavors at bay. I don't recommend roasting to Full City or beyond for this reason unless you are shooting for espresso. If you're roasting on a Behmor, it's worth sticking to 150g or less and giving the grid drum a good shake to let the tiniest fall through the mesh rather than in the bottom of the roast chamber.</p> </div>

<p>Hamasho is the type of dry process ("DP") coffee that you may run out of adjectives describing the cup profile. It's just so fruited and delicious. But more than that, it is a refined cup for DP making the flavor notes a lot easier to pick out, even for the casual drinker. At City roast, the dry fragrance has a berry smell that reminds me of mixed berry Kool Aid powder, so sweet and fruity, notes of fruit candies, orange and strawberry too. Pouring the water over the grounds punctuates the complex fruit characteristics and weaves together a broad palette of fruited notes like blueberry, tropical fruits, banana and orange creamsicle. Before I get into the cup flavors, I want to point out that City and City+ roasts are where I tasted the cleanest fruit flavor notes, topped off with a delicate floral aroma that screams "Guji" coffee. The cup is loaded with complex fruited flavors like red raspberry, tart blueberry, mango, peach puree and strawberry Starburst candies. A black tea characteristic adds a tannic aspect to the mouthfeel, like the pleasant bittering of iced tea. One of the most surprising elements in the cup is the vibrant lemon flavor that shoots up through it all, chalking up yet another reason why this DP is so unique. Two things worth noting: One, there are some very small beans in this coffee (likely 14 screen, maybe even a few 13 screen). If you're roasting with a Behmor, I recommend giving the drum a shake before loading in order to let those smallest beans shake free which will keep them from smoldering in the bottom of the roast chamber. It also produces a lot of chaff, so keep roast batches to less than 1/2 lb in the Behmor (I'd go 1/4 lb to start) or any other roaster where chaff is not pulled from the drum during the roast. </p> </div>
