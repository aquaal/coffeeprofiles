Extra care goes into these smaller competition lots, with hand sorting employed in addition to the regular machine milling procedures.

My Full City roast smelled a bit too dark, bittering cocoa roast tones coming off on the ashy side, at least in smells. I found City+ to be this coffee's sweet spot, or at least \&quot;sweetest\&quot; spot. City roasts are just too nutty for my taste, and Full City too bittering. That makes for a fairly narrow roast target, and I suggest for those roasting on a popper to really pay attention to the physical bean color, and no matter what machine your using, wait til at least the end of 1st crack to finish your roast batch. Depending on your roaster, the time between 1st and 2nd snaps will vary, but as a rule of thumb give the coffee at least a few seconds more in the roaster after 1st snaps have completed before pulling. The cup profile is simple, if not basic, and will appeal to those looking for solid sweet to bittering tones, raw sugar and roasted nut flavors, and mild acidity. The finish is slightly tannic, and a savory roasted seed flavor comes through in the aftertaste that reminds me of tahini, or those roasted sesame candies. An all around solid daily drinking coffee, that will also add body and creamy nut tones to an espresso blend too.&quot;}">The dry fragrance has a sugar-coated almond smell, with a subtle hint of dried banana, and peanut.
