The wetted grounds are so caramely sweet, like caramel cookies with raisins, and topped with a hint of cinnamon tea. City roasts brew nicely, delicious spice notes up front, along with a compound of raw sugar flavors offering more than enough backing sweetness. A compromise is often made when light roasting, trading out developed sweetness for acidity and complexity. But this isn't the case with Kazoza N'Ikawa, and the cooling cup has a sweetness like sugarcane juice, that along with a dried apple note, resonate into the aftertaste. Acidity really pops at this roast level too, fruited for sure, a tartness that's like a rindy lemon flavor and mouthfeel. Brewing my Full City roast, I was surprised by a dark grape flavor that crops up after the temperature cools down a bit. Heavy dark chocolate roast tones crop up too, and the two pair well together, leaving a lasting impression in the long finish. Kazoza N'Ikawa is so sweet and complex from as light as City and on up to Full City roast levels, and those patient enough to let cool will be duly rewarded. &quot;}">What a lovely smelling coffee, Kazoza N'Ikawa is perfumed in City and City+ roasts, a sugar browning sweetness along with a mix of clove spice and orange accents. The wetted grounds are so caramely sweet, like caramel cookies with raisins, and topped with a hint of cinnamon tea. City roasts brew nicely, delicious spiced sweetness notes up front, a compound of raw sugar flavors and delicate baking spice accents. A compromise is often made when light roasting, trading out developed sweetness for acidity and complexity. But this isn't the case with Kazoza N'Ikawa, and the cooling cup has a sweetness like sugarcane juice, that along with raisin and dried apple notes, resonate in the aftertaste. Acidity really pops at this roast level too and has a tart-sweetness like Palestinian sweet limes (if you haven't had them, they produce all the lime flavor without a puckering level of tartness!). Brewing my Full City roast, I was surprised by a dark grape hint that crops up after the temperature cools down a bit. Heavy dark chocolate roast tones are dominant, and the two pair well together, leaving behind a smokey-roast finish.
