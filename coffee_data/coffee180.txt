<p>This is our one and only Gesha lot from what has become a customer favorite - Guatemala Acatenango Gesha. We've been lucky enough to be the sole buyer of this coffee for several years now. They've continued to plant more coffee each year and what started as a handful of bags annually, has ballooned to 90 bags this time around! If the volume isn't impressive enough, we are stunned at the consistent high quality that is achieved, this year's coffee scoring above 93 points! If you don't know the story of the Gesha cultivar, it is an old coffee type from Ethiopia that was brought to an experimental coffee garden in Costa Rica years ago as a specimen sample. It was distributed to a few farms for testing on small plots, but not much was thought of it until one of these, Esmeralda in Panama, separated it from the other cultivars and entered it in the national competition. It was so outrageously different, with fruited and floral character like a Yirga Cheffe coffee from half a world away. Now that the word is out, other farms that received some of the seed have tried to separate their Gesha coffee as well, as is the case here. The results are always a bit different: the cultivar "expresses" itself differently in terms of cup flavors at each location, influenced by weather, soil, altitude and the like. And with this coffee from the region of Acatenango, we have a Gesha cup that expresses much of that floral intensity that's become synonymous with the "Gesha" name. Harvest was quite productive this year again as the owner of the farm has dedicated even more of his farm to this varietal, which after putting it to the cup test we've decided is a very good thing. We're the sole buyer of this coffee and have chosen to keep certain farm specifics to ourselves. The farm sits on the steep slopes of Volcan Acatenango between 1600 - 1700 meters and reaps the benefits of rich volcanic soil. This farm has been in the same family for a couple generations now and they've built out an impressive wet milling facility onsite as well.</p> </div>

<p>There's nothing quite like fresh Gesha from this Acatenango farm, which is why we've gone back for all of their output year after year. The cup profile has such a refined sweetness, and jasmine floral notes are perfumed and way out front. As tasted in previous lots, unique tea notes proliferate in both aroma and cup flavors, from pearl jasmine to Assam teas, and tannic mouthfeel has a mouth cleansing affect on the finish. Both dry fragrance and wet aroma have honeyed sweetness, as well as potent tropical passion fruit and guava notes. Light roasts have pristine sweetness with similarities to pressed sugar cane juice and honey. It presents a sweet backdrop for contrasting tea-like accent notes such as Assam and the floral, tart aspects of rose hips to stand out against. As the cup cools, perfumed floral notes are increasingly pronounced, and the leading aromatic features are like star jasmine flowers and rose water. The cup has moderate acidity that comes off very tea-like, and with a lemon element as well. This coffee's fruited side was accurately described by one of our cuppers as tasting like "bubblegum", the original pink kind with its fruited candy sweetness. I don't recommend Full City roasts for brew, as most of the floral and tea notes will be compromised. However, it will make for a chocolate-y and super floral espresso should you choose to go this route (or wind up roasting dark on accident!). But for brewing, keep this one light and bright, and enjoy the incredibly complex floral cup that is uniquely Gesha. </p> </div>
