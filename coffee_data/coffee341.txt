<p>Edward Sandoval worked for many years as a field technician for the Federacion Nacional de Cafeteros ("FNC"), assisting farmers with technical support to maximize their harvest yield. When he broke away from the FNC and set out to start his own farm, Finca Canta Ranas, he decided to plant varieties that were not promoted by his previous employer due to their need for a higher degree of management, but that are capable of producing a higher value cup, like Wush Wush, Gesha and Moka. This is a departure from his time with the FNC where farmers are encouraged to plant higher yielding plants that are easier to grow, like Variedad Colombia for example. So far, his extra efforts have paid off. Edward's farm is small, just 3 hectares, and this lot is 100% Moka cultivar (or "Mokka"), a short, bushy coffee shrub that produces the tiniest little beans that look more like peas than coffee. They're roughly 11 1/64 of an inch in size and are quite round. The small size makes them a little difficult to roast and I generally recommend trying to stick to a lighter roast level. I do not recommend roasting this coffee in a Behmor as the beans will slip through the grid drum. Best left to roasting in air or drum roasters. In addition to being small in size, they make a very small sound when they crack, so pay close attention as you near the normal 1st crack stage. Moka trees have a very low yield, and this lot is a mere 100 lbs bag. As such, we are only offering 1 LB bags in the hopes of spreading it to as many customers as possible. </p> </div>

<p>These Moka coffee beans are tiny, like REALLY tiny. As such, don't try roasting this coffee in a Behmor since they'll fall right through the grid drum. This small-screen coffee is ideal for air roasting or drum roasting, but be alert when listening for 1st Crack, as like the bean, the sound is also quite small (though present). Light and middle roasts are ideal, capping the top end recommendation at City+. In this tight range you'll capture a balanced sweetness that has caramel and raw sugars, as well as an apple-like acidity and flavor that is well-integrated into the sweetness. Smells in the dry grounds and aroma have a marshmallow aspect to them, with hints of caramel-coated nut and roasted grains. City roasts perhaps the most complex in terms of acidity and top notes, but I enjoyed both of my roasts. Light roasts show a nice, grounded sweetness, with hints of green tea ice cream, a muted floral fruit note and mouthcleansing finish. City+ has more of a black currant/dried berry fruit aspect and with focused bittersweetness and body. I enjoyed brewing a 50/50 blend of the two, capturing the best of both roasts - body, bittersweetness, acidity and very soft fruited hints. Not many Moka cultivar samples make it to our cupping table, so we're pleased to have the opportunity to share this unique coffee with you, even if in such small supply - 1 LB bags only.</p> </div>
