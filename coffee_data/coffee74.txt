<p>Keramo coffees come from a privately owned processing site near Keramo Village, tucked away in the Bombe mountains of Ethiopia's Sidama growing region. Along with coffee from their own farm called "Daye Bensa", they are buying and processing coffee from local farmers from three different growing areas nearby such as Shantawene, Bombe and Keramo villages. This lot is made up from coffees grown by farmers only in Keramo village, none of their own estate coffee or coffees from the nearby villages are mixed in. The Keramo site is really high up there, over 2,200 meters above sea level! It's astonishing, really, and not only responsible for producing super dense coffee, but you see some smaller size beans too. The station and farms are certified organic too, though we brought in without the certificate this year. But it does mean they go to great lengths to register every small farmer who they buy from and certify that organic agricultural practices are being employed at the farm level (they're also Rain Forest Alliance and UTZ certified). A note on the small beans. The majority of the coffee is 15+, but we are spotting quite a few 13 and 14 screen beans in there too. The biggest concern here is that these smaller, lower density beans will roast faster than the largest coffee. While that can be true, we found that either sticking to City to City+ roast range or slowing down the last leg of the roast helps keep the small beans from charring and darker 'roast' flavors at bay. I don't recommend roasting to Full City or beyond for this reason unless you are shooting for espresso. If you're roasting on a Behmor, it's worth sticking to 150g or less and giving the grid drum a good shake to let the tiniest fall through the mesh rather than in the bottom of the roast chamber.</p> </div>

<p>The coffee smells particularly sweet in lighter roasts. Both City and City+ have a raw sugar scent beneath bold berry and fruit smells that are much more than mere accents. They are what defines Keramo's cup too. It's a fruit bomb exploding with a multitude of fresh and dried fruited flavor notes and with impressive sweetness. Light roasts bring out big fruited flavors of strawberry, cranberry juice, berry wine and honeydew melon. There's a bright aspect in the complex array of fruits that comes through like tart berry, and casts an acidic impression on the cup. A delicate floral accent adds an aromatic highlight to the coffee as it cools, as does an herbal rue note. Keramo is very juicy, quite clean for dry process coffee and has body like coconut water. It excels as a light roasted coffee and any darker than City+ risks compromising this flavorful brew by introducing smokey roast tones that will add an ashy hue to the coffee. Two things worth noting: One, there are some very small beans in this coffee. If you're roasting with a Behmor, I recommend giving the drum a shake before loading in order to let those smallest beans shake free which will keep them from smoldering in the bottom of the roast chamber. It also produces a lot of chaff, so keep roast batches to less than 1/2 lb in the Behmor (I'd go 1/4 lb to start). Also, the first 'snaps' of 1st Crack are very subtle at first in comparison to most other coffees and I really had to pay attention to pick up on it. Because of this, my first pass went a little dark. It was a good mistake to make because I can now say with confidence that Full City is just too dang dark for this coffee! Once I figured this out, I paid closer attention to both sight and sound and had no further issues. </p> </div>
